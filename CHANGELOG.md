* Add option for OpenShift to use a proxy server
* Add picture of finished infrastructure to README
* Add READMEâ€™s for each role
* Make ssh-copy-id role idempotent
* Add an option to automte the creation of an LPAR and install RHEL on KVM host

## <u>Infrastructure Nodes, Extra Apps, Security</u>
Version: 1.3.0 \
Released: 2022-01-06 
* ### Summary 
    * Now able to designate compute nodes as infrastructure nodes, and create optional RHEL VMs for additional non-cluster applications running on the KVM host.
    * Made changes to SSH and SELinux tasks to be more secure.
* ### Added
    * Support for creating infrastructure nodes and extra apps.
    * Added tcp port 53 to firewall.
    * Setting of permissions and ownership of important configuration files to bastion admin user instead of root.
    * Wheel to groups that bastion admin user is added to on boot.
    * More rounds of checking cluster operators and CSRs in verification steps to ensure the playbook doesn't fail if it takes a long time for those steps to complete.
    * Task to httpd to allow port 4443 because SELinux is no longer set to permissive (see '[Removed](###Removed)' below).
* ### Modified
    * Formatting of README file to be prettier and more useful.
    * Ansible connection to SSH with password authentication since it was necessary for copying SSH keys anyway. Kept copying of SSH keys to Ansible-managed servers because it's still useful to have.
    * env.yaml to have two sections separated by a comment block: one for variables that need to be filled out, the other for pre-filled variables that can be modified if desired.
    * Ansible user from running as root to an admin user with sudo privileges.
* ### Removed
    * The need to run anything as root user for security reasons.
    * set_selinux_permissive mode role for security reasons.

## <u>Scaling</u>
Version: 1.2.0 \
Released: 2021-12-09
* ### Summary
    * Now supports any number of control and compute nodes to be provisioned in the cluster.
    * This update heavily modifies the variable structure in env.yaml in order to make scaling work.
* ### Added
    * Support for scaling of control and compute nodes.
* ### Modified
    * Variable structure in env.yaml in order to support scaling.
    * Tags to match their corresponding role.
    * Every reference to a variable from env.yaml to match the new structure.

## <u>Automated OCP Verification</u>
Version: 1.1.0 \
Released: 2021-12-03
* ### Summary
    * Fully automated all OCP verification steps. Cutting the number of steps nearly in half. The main playbook can now run completely hands-off from kicking it off all the way to an operational cluster. The last step provides the first-time login credentials.
* ### Added
    * 5 roles related to automating OCP verification steps: wait_for_bootstrap, approve_certs, check_nodes, wait_for_cluster_operators, and wait_for_install_complete.
    * Role to check internal and external DNS configuration before continuing. Including checking to make sure the name resolves to the correct IP address.
* ### Modified
    * The mirrors for CoreOS versions to update to 4.9 and tested them.
    * The acquisition method of RHEL qcow2 from downloading via ephemeral link to having the user download the file to their local machine as a pre-req. This was changed to avoid having to re-copy the link every time it expires.
    * teardown.yaml and reset_files role to be fully idempotent when running the main playbook from the point where each type of teardown sets the user back to.
    * Lots of small tweaks.
* ### Removed
    * Instructions in README for doing OCP verification steps manually

## <u>Automated Bastion Install</u>
Version: 1.0.0 \
Released: 2021-11-24
* ### Summary
    * Fully automated bastion installation and configuration using cloud-init
* ### Added
    * Options in env.yaml for creating a DNS server on the bastion or not, and for automatically attaching Red Hat subscriptions
    * Variables for bootstrap, bastion, control and compute nodes' specifications in env.yaml
    * Node name variables in env.yaml
    * Variable for network interface name in env.yaml
    * Variable for DNS forwarder in env.yaml
    * Templating of DNS configuration files so they don't have to be pre-provided
    * Expect script to ssh_copy_id role so that the user doesn't have to type in ssh password when copying ssh key
    * Templating of haproxy config file
    * A boot_teardown tag in teardown.yaml to automate the teardown of bootstrap node
* ### Modified
    * create_bastion role to use cloud-init to fully automate configuration and installation of the bastion node
    * teardown.yaml script to decrease complexity and work faster.
    * Some tags to match their corresponding role names
    * Lots of small improvements and tweaks
* ### Removed
    * Encryption of env.yaml as it was unnecessary and increased complexity
